## Problem statement

In the domain of image processing, object segmentation is a essential task. Many techniques can be employed to solve this problem,

1. image segmentation
2. disadvantages of common edge detector
3. active contour: advantage
4. Problem: not able to capture corners with common $$ \beta $$.
5. Idea: spatially dependent $$ \beta $$ capture corners
6. Mixture gaussian distribution
